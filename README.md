# Titanic Disaster Analysis and Modelling

Building predictive model with aim to predict which passengers would have survived the Titanic shipwreck disaster

[Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Some highlights in this project report:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis based on EDA about factor(s) which affect the passenger survivability
- Handling missing values: KNN imputation, median age based on passenger title name
- Predictive model: decision tree, support vector machine, random forest
- Improvement by feature selection
